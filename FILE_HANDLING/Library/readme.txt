This sample project is for CBSE class 12 students, it will help them to understand how simple but powerful projects can be developed in python programming language together with its easy to use binary file handling mechanism.

About the project: We went to the best library in the locality and asked details about the features that they want in a library management software. Accordingly we developed this project in python to fulfill their needs.

Here is an overview of the components of this project:
